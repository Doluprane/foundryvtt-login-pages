# Summary
Hello there,<br>
This small css package aims to enhance and beautify the default log-in screen of the famous roleplaying platform [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).
Below you'll find everything you need to use the package.

# Requirements
* A minimal resolution of 870px by 500px (shouldn't be an issue as Foundry requires 1024px by 700px to work).
* An access to your Foundry instance to modify files.

# Deployment
* OPTIONAL: Update your world's background (using the *Administrator Setup*).
* Upload your world logo in your FoundryVTT instance.
    * I advise you to use the *Administrator Setup* in the same way as if you were updating the world's background WITHOUT clicking on *Update World*. This will upload the file in the root directory of your FoundryVTT instance.
* Overwrite your ```$foundry_path/resources/app/templates/setup/join-game.hbs``` with ![the one in the repo](join-game.hbs).
* Concatenate your ```$foundry_path/resources/app/public/css/foundry2.css``` with (for example) ![The Witcher style](the-witcher/foundry2.css).
* Don't forget to configure your updated CSS in the *Configuration Area*.

# Known bugs
* If you upgrade your instance of FoundryVTT, you'll loose everything related to this package (backups are your friends).
* Some drop-down buttons have their style changed in the *Administrator Setup* (only seen in "Application Configuration" and "Update"; this will not impact game sessions).
* The H1 title (usually "FoundryVTT") shown in *Administrator Setup* is hidden (this will not impact game sessions).
